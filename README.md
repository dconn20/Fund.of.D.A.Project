#### OVERVIEW OF PROJECT
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************

In this project you must perform and explain simple linear regression using Python
on the powerproduction dataset. The goal is to accurately predict
wind turbine power output from wind speed values using the data set as a basis.

Your submission must be in the form of a git repository containing, at a minimum, the
following items:

1. Jupyter notebook that performs simple linear regression on the data set.

2. In that notebook, an explanation of your regression and an analysis of its accuracy.

3. Standard items in a git repository such as a README.

To enhance your submission, you might consider comparing simple linear regression to
other types of regression on this data set.

#### PACKAGES USED IN THIS PROJECT
************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
The following packages were used to run analysis for this project.

Anaconda https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/ - is the easiest way to perfrom Python data science machine learning on Linux, Windows and Mac OS.

Python https://www.python.org/downloads/ - An interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language

iPython https://ipython.org/ - it an interactive command-line terminal for Python.

Jupyter Notebook https://jupyter.org/ - is an open-source web application that allows the creation and sharing of documents that contains live code, equations, visualisations and narriative text

Numpy http://www.numpy.org/ - is the fundamental package for scientific computing within Python.

Pandas https://pandas.pydata.org/ - Python library used for for data manipulation and analysis

Matplotlib.pylab https://matplotlib.org/ - Python library used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations

Seaborn https://seaborn.pydata.org/ - Python data visualization library based on matplotlib

Scipy https://www.scipy.org/ - a Python-based ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering

Scikit-learn https://scikit-learn.org/ - Machine learning library for the Python programming language

#### INSTRUCTIONS
*************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Once you install Anaconda, the packages listed above will also be installed.

First go to https://github.com/dconn20/Fund.of.D.A.Project.git and download the repository

Navigate to the correct folder on your terminal where you have saved the repository

You can now run the notebook by typing jupyter notebook in the command prompt

A window or tab should open in your default web browser. If this does not happen the command prompt output will provide a URL which you can copy and paste into your web browser to access jupyter notebook

Double click the jupyter notebook file and the notebook should open in a new tab

When opened select run all cells

Please note that certain cells must be run before others, such as importing the libraries
